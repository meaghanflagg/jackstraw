Overview
========

This package performs association tests between the observed data and their systematic patterns of variation. This package implements methods from (Chung and Storey, 2015) in python. For an R version (which we followed closely) see https://github.com/ncchung/jackstraw.

Installation
============
This is currently an informal package under development so I've only made it installable from github.

::

    git clone https://github.com/idc9/jackstraw.git
    python setup.py install

Example
=======

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    from jackstraw import jackstraw

    X = np.random.normal(size=(100, 20))
    jack = Jackstraw(S = 10, B = 100)
    jack.fit(X, method='pca', rank=4)
    jack.rejected

.. code::

    array([], dtype=int64)

For some more example code see `these example notebooks`_.
